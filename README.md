Uploaded the chrome notification script. Should have tested to see if it runs as local user or if you need admin. 99% sure that you are going to need to run it as admin which makes me think I should just elevete the script at the beginning. But please if you run into issues with the script please let me know.

I updated the 365 script to include a couple of transport rules. These could have been done in other places however I like using the transport rules as they are pretty simple if statments that do what they are told. Please be careful with the TLD filter. It has capacity to block legitimate emails. This was made in the mind set of a Australian company that doesn't deal with alot of overseas companies or domains.

Updated the 365 security script to make it a little easier for people to drop and play. 
Changed variables on the 365 script so that it can be used on the go. You can also just statically assign these so that they just stay put and you don't have to go and reenter these every time.

Added MapEmail_Without_automap.ps1
Found that to many mailboxes made my computer sad when I opened outlook. So by going through and changing all the mailboxes to not automap to outlook, means I only get the mailboxes that I actually want through to my outlook profile.
