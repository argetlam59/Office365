Updated the 365 security script to make it a little easier for people to drop and play. 
Changed variables on the 365 script so that it can be used on the go. You can also just statically assign these so that they just stay put and you don't have to go and reenter these every time.

Added MapEmail_Without_automap.ps1
Found that to many mailboxes made my computer sad when I opened outlook. So by going through and changing all the mailboxes to not automap to outlook, means I only get the mailboxes that I actually want through to my outlook profile.
